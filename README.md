The *Evaluation Coding Test* is aimed at giving the supervisors the ability to understand an employee's IntelliJ, Git and Maven Infrastructure handling,his coding skills as well as his algorithmic way of thinking.

The project was developed through the *Maven* software management tool and was completed in *Java* programming language. The testing procedure was executed through *JUnit* test framework and maven *Surefire* plugin. The code files are fully documented, Javadoced and fully tested. </br>The *Evaluation Coding Test* consists of three classes, as well as their corresponding test classes. </br>The three main classes are the following: 

* *StatisticUtilsArray* : The implementation of this class allows the retrieval of some basic statistical features of a given **array**. The data type of the array is **double**. These features are:
	1. Minumum Value
	2. Maximum Value
	3. Median Value
	4. Mean Value
	5. Standard Deviation Value

* *StatisticUtilsArrayList* : The implementation of this class allows the retrieval of some basic statistical features of a given **ArrayList**. The data type of the ArrayList is **Double**. These features are:
	1. Minumum Value
	2. Maximum Value
	3. Median Value
	4. Mean Value
	5. Standard Deviation Value

* *AscendingMinima* : The implementation of this class allows the computation of the *ascending minima* array of a given initial *array* or *ArrayList*, as it is defined from the ***Ascending Minimum Algorithm***. The data dype of the *array* is **double** and of the *ArrayList* is **Double**. The class also implements the ability to insert a new number into the initial array and compute the new *ascending minima* array.
